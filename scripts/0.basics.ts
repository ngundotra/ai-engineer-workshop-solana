 * - `devnet` - fake tokens, used for testing dApps and programs in a mainnet-like environment
 *    - similar idea of a "staging environment" in web2 software development
 * - `testnet` - used to test the new features of the Solana blockchain
 * - `localnet` - run a local Solana validator/network on your machine for testing
 *    - requires the Solana CLI be installed, but gives a better developer experience
